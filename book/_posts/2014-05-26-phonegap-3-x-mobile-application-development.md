The book explores several important topics, including globalization, persistent storage, audio recording and playback, video recording and playback, image capture, GPS, the accelerometer, and much, much more. To explore these topics, the book guides you through the development of several apps, including a productivity app, a path-recording app, and a game.

Approach:
A practical guide written in a tutorial-style, this book walks you step-by-step through 12 individual projects to create real world apps. Each project moves through design and implementation of the app, and also provides suggestions to enhance it.

Who this book is for:
If you are a mobile developer who is familiar with Phonegap basics and wants to quickly create some cool mobile applications with PhoneGap, this book is for you. You should have some experience working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and also be able to use your operating system's command-line interface. No experience with Java, or ObjC is required.
