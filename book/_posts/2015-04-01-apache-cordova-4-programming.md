This is a book about Apache Cordova, the leading framework for building native mobile applications for multiple target platforms using HTML5 (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS). As Adobe PhoneGap is just a distribution of Apache Cordova, this book is also about Adobe PhoneGap. You’ll find any differences between the two clearly described herein. The book is for mobile developers who want to learn about Apache Cordova 4. If you’re brand- new to Cordova, then this book will be just what you need to get started. If you’re experienced with an older version of Cordova, this book can act as a refresher, plus it will show you in detail how to use all of the new stuff that’s in Cordova 4. You should have at least some experience with mobile development to directly benefit from this book. For web developers who want to get into mobile development using Apache Cordova, the book includes content that shows how to install and use the native SDKs, but it doesn't cover many native-specific topics.
