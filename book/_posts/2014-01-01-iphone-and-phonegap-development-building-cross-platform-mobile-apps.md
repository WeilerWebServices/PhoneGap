The book is intended as a guide for those developers who would like to start creating their own mobile applications for one of the most popular mobile platforms today - iOS and its iPhone and iPad devices. The book is designed so that a user who has a basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML5, could be able to create a step -by-step complete functional mobile application, and upload it to the App Store, either to sell or offer it for free. All of this without the knowledge of the native programming for the iOS platform.
The book is also suitable for advanced developers who already have with JavaScript and HTML5 experience and would like to learn how to use their prior knowledge for the development of mobile applications for the iPhone and other platforms and also learn a lot of useful information about the user interface, optimizing applications to run on real device, or extension plugins, thus saving a considerable amount of time.
