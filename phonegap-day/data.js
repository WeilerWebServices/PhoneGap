This workshop will give you a chance to get hands-on experience building PhoneGap applications that interact with Bluetooth Smart devices. We will cover Bluetooth LE concepts like services and characteristics while we are building the software. The mobile application will be written with PhoneGap so it will run on iOS or Android. The phone will control hardware via Bluetooth LE, and automatically receive notifications when something changes on the peripheral. Participants will be required to bring a laptop and are encouraged to bring a Bluetooth LE-capable iOS or Android phone. There will be a limited number of phones that people can borrow for the workshop. Familiarity with at least one programming language is helpful but not required. A list of required free software will be sent to attendees before the workshop.'

This workshop will show not only the importance of security and privacy, but some basic steps we as developers can take to ensure our apps are a safe place for our users (not to mention keeping the app safe from those same users). From avoiding XSS, understanding the whitelist and CSP, to ensuring that what data we do collect is kept safe. This workshop will give you a better understanding of how to ensure privacy and security are a part of your app from day one."
