    <h2>// Workshops</h2>
    <p>Dive deeper into PhoneGap by attending our pre-conference workshops on Thursday, October 23rd. Choose between two different tracks:</p>

    <h3>PhoneGap, from beginner to God Mode</h3><br/>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Beginner: Intro to PhoneGap</b><br>
<!--        <i>Workshops led by Christophe Coenraets and Holly Schinsky</i><br>-->
This workshop will provide an introduction to PhoneGap, the philosophy behind it and how to get started quickly using a variety of different tools available. The CLI, PhoneGap Developer App, PhoneGap Build and more will be shown and you will learn about the many frameworks available to choose from when building your mobile apps. You will also be shown debugging techniques and walk away with a solid understanding of what PhoneGap is all about. Lastly you can expect to hear an introduction to the PhoneGap Enterprise offering Adobe has been working on.
</li>

    <li><b>Advanced: Architecting PhoneGap apps</b><br>
<!--        <i>Workshops led by Christophe Coenraets</i><br>-->
Learn how to architect large, complex, and native-like PhoneGap apps using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We will investigate mobile challenges and find solutions for them as well as learn all about Single Page Architecture, HTML templates, effective touch events, performance techniques, MVC Frameworks and more. In this session you will also learn more about PhoneGap Enterprise and see how page editing and content update works.
    </li>

    <li><b>God Mode: Building an app from scratch and more...</b><br>
<!--        <i>Workshops led by Holly Schinsky</i><br>-->
In this session we’ll build a full-blown mobile application from scratch for a real world scenario using PhoneGap and a popular UI framework stack. You will learn how to implement various plugins and all about the plugin architecture in general so you can go build your own custom plugins in the future. We’ll use the tools introduced in the first session and knowledge gleaned throughout the day to help solidify the concepts. You’ll also delve more into the PhoneGap Enterprise offering and see a demo using a specific app that will show off some of the new features available.
    </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>PhoneGap Ecosystem: workshops from Microsoft, Mozilla, Mobify, Intel, Amazon, Telerik, and Google</h3><br/>
    <ul>
<li><b>Use Visual Studio to build Cordova apps for Windows, Windows Phone, Android and iOS! - with Ryan J. Salva and Dan Levine</b>
    <br />
The Visual Studio team has created an extension for Visual Studio that allows creating, debugging, deploying Cordova apps not only for Windows devices, but also for Android and iOS. The development experience across platforms becomes integrated and seamless. Come meet Ryan and Dan from the Visual Studio team building this extension who will show you how to use Visual Studio to make the magic happen.
<br /><br />
If you want to get started during the workshop, make sure you have a machine with Windows 8 And Visual Studio 2013 Pro or above installed. This can be a VM running on a Mac (you can find info on how to set things up on this post), and you can use the trial version of Visual Studio 2013 from here.
 <br><br></li>
        <li><b>Apache Cordova for Windows Store and Windows Phone apps - Olivier Bloch, Eric Mittelette (MS Open Tech)</b>
            <br /><br />
Have you considered porting your existing Android or iOS PhoneGap/Cordova app to Windows Store and or Windows Phone? Cordova support for Windows devices is permanently improving with regular contributions from Microsoft Open Tech and other Microsoft teams, taking advantage of native support for HTML5/JavaScript development on the latest versions of Windows and Windows Phone. During this workshop we will show you what the state of the art is and point out what the potential challenges are for you to port your existing Android or iOS PhoneGap app to Windows and Windows Phone Stores and give you access to a large set of new users with a minimum effort.
             <br><br></li>
        
        
        
        <li><b>PhoneGap – Firefox OS App Workshop - with Piotr Zalewa & Vishy Krishnamoorthy</b>
            <br />
Firefox OS is an open source operating system for mobile built using HTML5, Javascript and open web standards. Firefox OS integration with Apache Cordova / Adobe PhoneGap began early this year, and development is ongoing. As Firefox OS continues to expand to new markets around the world, there's a great opportunity for multi-platform app developers like you. If you are interested in porting an application built with Cordova to Firefox OS, this workshop will get you up and running. Participants will have the opportunity to go home with a Firefox OS Flame reference device.
<br /><br />
We'll begin with the current status of the Firefox OS Cordova integration, including demos of building and debugging basic Cordova Apps using Firefox’s new Web IDE. The rest of the workshop will be hands-on: we'll help you run your app on a Firefox OS device. Some of the topics that we'll cover:
<br /><br />
1 - Installing and setting up Firefox OS with Cordova<br />
2 - Demos of Cordova plugins that support Firefox OS<br />
3 - Connecting a Firefox OS phone and pushing your app to a live device<br />
4 - Overview of all available developer tools<br />
5 - Editing and live debugging your Firefox App with the App Manager and WebIDE<br />
6 - Experimenting with the PhoneGap Developer App<br />
<br /><br /></li>
        
        
        <li><b>Intel® XDK – An IDE for Cordova!? - with Paul Fischer</b>
        <br />
        The Intel® XDK HTML5 is a free mobile app development tool utilizing a collection of open-source technologies to simplify the hybrid mobile app development cycle. In this quick survey of the tool I will demonstrate:
<ul>
    <li>Utilizing the Crosswalk webview for Android Cordova apps</li>
    <li>Build services for Crosswalk, Android, iOS and Win 8 Tablet</li>
    <li>App testing and debug with on-device debug and live preview</li>
    <li>Linking drag-and-drop UI widgets directly to RESTful web service APIs</li>
    </ul>
        </li>
    
        
        <li><b>Perceived Performance In Phonegap Apps - with Zachary Halvorson & Kyle Peatt</b>
            <br />
Making users believe your app is fast is just as important as actual speed. Your users don’t care about the metrics behind performance — they care about how fast it feels. In this workshop we'll cover the history of perceived performance, how you can measure it and provide practical skills for improving how fast your application feels.  Some of the strategies we'll cover include providing instant feedback, seamless feeling loading animations, taking advantage of the GPU and familiar physics for gestures as well as pre-emptive loading performance hacks.
        <br><br></li>
        
        <li><b>Multi-Device HTML5 Hybrid Web Apps with Amazon WebView - with Russell Beattie and Archana Naik</b>
 <br />
Learn how to develop web apps that run seamlessly on multiple Amazon Fire devices (tablet and phone) using the advanced HTML5 capabilities and functionality of the Amazon WebView API. In this talk we'll build a single Apache Cordova (PhoneGap) hybrid web app for Fire OS that dynamically adapts to each platform, taking advantage of platform-specific features such as the head tracking APIs on Fire phone. We'll also take a look at custom Cordova plugins that can expand the functionality of our web app to access native capabilities such as device detection, or to use services such as Amazon's Device Messaging (ADM).
            <br/><br/>
        </li>
        
        <li><b>The Telerik Platform—Cordova Apps Made Easy - with TJ VanToll & Jennifer Looper</b>
            <br/>
Building hybrid apps is hard. In addition to actually coding an application, you also have to deal platform-specific configuration files, icons, permissions, deployment procedures, and more. That's where Telerik comes in. With a series of tools—including cloud-based builds, dozens of high-quality (and free) Cordova plugins, and a whole lot more—Telerik provides everything you need to take the pain out of hybrid development.
<br/><br/>
In this workshop you'll build two complete apps: a photo album and a grocery list manager. You'll see how to tackle tough problems such as user management, authentication, and storing data in the cloud. Come learn how you can focus less on the platform-specific nuances of hybrid development, and more on building awesome apps.

        <li><b>Building a Chrome App for Android, Eh - with Michael Mocny</b>
            <br />
        We’re going to build the trendiest, simplest, social platform ever: Eh.  (Hey, I’m Canadian)
<br /><br />
We’ll build this application using the Chrome Apps for Mobile toolkit, and you'll learn to use Google Cloud Messaging, create Rich Notifications, login with device Identity, and add offline storage.  You'll also build a wonderfully fluid user experience using the Polymer project and Material Design (though we won't dive deep here), and create everything using HTML5 and JavaScript.
<br /><br />
Framework / toolkit: cca, CDE, CADT for Mobile
APIs: notifications, gcm, identity, storage
UI/UX: Polymer
