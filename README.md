### PhoneGap is the open source framework that gets you building amazing mobile apps using web technology

We created this approach to authoring apps because we're web developers at ‚ù§, and wanted to remove the complexity of writing an app in multiple languages (like Objective C and Java) for all of the relevant mobile platforms. With PhoneGap you build beautiful cross-platform apps using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

#### RAPID DEVELOPMENT = BETTER APPS

For web developers with a history of creating outstanding user experiences and products, PhoneGap is the tool to use to quickly transfer web development skills into making awesome mobile apps. Leverage the web technologies that you know and love to make more time for rapid iterations and releases. By releasing your mobile app early and often, and gathering metrics for quick iterations, your customers get what they want and need.

#### CROSS PLATFORM = GREATER REACH

There is nothing worse than making your hugely anticipated/successful/helpful mobile app only available for a single platform. It means missing out on a huge part of your potential customer base. By using PhoneGap you can create an app for each of the platforms that you choose, using a single code base. Focus on creating a great experience for all of your potential customers instead of authoring complex platform compatibility layers --- it just makes sense.

#### NATIVE APIS = NATIVE FUNCTIONALITY

Developing your mobile app using HTML, CSS and Javascript doesn't mean that you have to give up on native functionality that makes mobile devices so extraordinary. PhoneGap gives you access to all of the native device APIs (like camera, GPS, accelerometer and more), so that the app you build with web tech behaves just like a native app. It's pretty cool.

#### OPEN SOURCE = GREAT COMMUNITY

By remaining free and open source, PhoneGap makes mobile app development accessible to thousands of web developers. We have great community support, which means that there are more people available to help you out and to keep the software current and robust. The Adobe PhoneGap team remains highly active in the stewardship and development of the Apache Cordova project.
