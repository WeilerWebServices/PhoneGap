# Stockpile App Documentation

These lesson folders are meant to be used in conjunction with the
(Stockpile Tutorial)[https://docs.phonegap.com/tutorials/stockpile/]
on the PhoneGap Docs site.

There is a folder for each lesson that contains any file modified in that lesson
in the state that the file should be in by the end of that lesson.

If you are following along and get lost or have an error you cannot reconcile,
simply compare the state of these files to yours. Worst case, you can replace
your files with the ones in these folders to get back up and running.
